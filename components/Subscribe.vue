  <h2>ðŸŽ“ Learn how the web works</h2>

  <p>
    Over my 20 year career in tech, I have noticed that an often-neglected part
    of interview prep is learning to explain technical concepts clearly. In my
    free newsletter, How the Web Works, I provide simple, bite-sized
    explanations for various web topics that you can use in your interview prep
    (or just to gain a better understanding of the web).
