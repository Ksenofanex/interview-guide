## Supporting my other projects

Second, you can support the other project I'm currently putting a lot of time in to: the How the Web Works newsletter, which I'm hoping will eventually become a full course. The premise of the newsletter is "simple, bite-sized explanations for various web topics." I'm currently following a roadmaps of sorts to logically explain, piece by piece, how the web works.

## Supporting financially

If you have the means, consider a _paid_ membership to the How the Web Works newsletter. There is a bit of extra content/exercises for paid members, but mostly it just goes to helping sustain my side projects like the newsletter or this interview guide.
