# Interview Guide

Welcome to my [interview guide](https://interviewguide.dev)!

My name is [Nick](https://nick.scialli.me) and I'm a senior software engineer at Microsoft. I have participated in around 100 software engineering interviews on both sides of the table&mdash;as a candidate and an interviewer. I have passed interviews at both big tech/FAANG companies as well as smaller startups.

This guide is my attempt to codify my opinionated interview process for the benefit of the software development community.
